# Route planner with A* algorithm (python)
- This is the project from Udacity's Introduction to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree Program.
- The code was developed based on the assignment from the Nanodegree program. 
- The assignment was to code a route-planning algorithm, A*, like the one used in Google Maps.

### Project Overview
### Goals
* Implement A* algorithm to find shortest distance given a start and goal node.
* Allow users to define choose two types of maps (10 nodes and 40 nodes) and to select the start and goal node.

### Structures
This project consists of three files:
* helpers.py: this code helps to load map data, defining map objects, and display maps.
* route_planner.ipynb: implementation of A* algorithm

### Run the code
To run the code:
1. Clone this respository: https://github.com/lucassuryana/route_planner.git 
2. Open route_planner.ipynb
3. Run all the chunks
